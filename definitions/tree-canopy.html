    <h1>Definition of Tree Canopy</h1>
    <p><strong>Tree Canopy</strong> refers to the layer of leaves, branches, and stems of trees that cover the ground when viewed from above. The tree canopy is a critical component of urban forests and green infrastructure, providing various ecological, social, and economic benefits.</p>

    <h2>Key Characteristics of Tree Canopy</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Coverage:</strong> Tree canopy coverage is often measured as a percentage of land area covered by the canopy of trees. It can vary widely depending on the density and size of trees in an area.</li>
        <li><strong>Urban Heat Island Mitigation:</strong> Tree canopies provide shade, reducing surface and air temperatures in urban areas, thus mitigating the urban heat island effect.</li>
        <li><strong>Air Quality Improvement:</strong> Trees filter pollutants from the air, improving air quality by capturing dust, particulate matter, and other pollutants.</li>
        <li><strong>Habitat and Biodiversity:</strong> Tree canopies provide habitat for various species, supporting biodiversity in urban environments.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Can Tree Canopy be Considered Stormwater Infrastructure?</h2>
    <p>Yes, tree canopies can be considered a form of stormwater infrastructure. Although they are not traditional hard infrastructure like pipes and drains, tree canopies contribute to stormwater management in several ways:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Interception:</strong> Tree canopies intercept rainfall, reducing the amount of water that reaches the ground. This interception can delay the onset of runoff and reduce the volume of stormwater that needs to be managed.</li>
        <li><strong>Evapotranspiration:</strong> Trees absorb water through their roots and release it into the atmosphere through transpiration, reducing the amount of water that remains on the surface and becomes runoff.</li>
        <li><strong>Infiltration:</strong> The root systems of trees enhance soil structure, increasing its permeability and allowing more water to infiltrate the ground rather than becoming surface runoff.</li>
        <li><strong>Pollutant Filtration:</strong> Tree canopies help filter pollutants from the air and rainfall, improving water quality by reducing the amount of contaminants that reach stormwater systems.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>While tree canopies are primarily known for their environmental and aesthetic benefits, they also play a significant role in stormwater management, making them a valuable component of green infrastructure. Their ability to intercept rainfall, promote infiltration, and improve water quality positions them as an effective and natural form of stormwater infrastructure.</p>
